# End-to-End Testing with Playwright

This directory contains end-to-end tests for the PowerPoint-like UI features implemented in the Presentation Hub editor.

## Setup

### Install Playwright browsers:
```bash
npm run playwright:install
```

Or manually:
```bash
npx playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

## Running Tests

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

### Run tests with UI mode (recommended for development):
```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

### Run tests in headed mode (see browser):
```bash
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### Debug tests:
```bash
npm run test:e2e:debug
```

### Run specific test file:
```bash
npx playwright test e2e/powerpoint-features.spec.ts

## Important Notes

### Authentication
These tests assume you have a way to bypass or handle authentication. You may need to:
1. Set up test user credentials in environment variables
2. Mock authentication for testing
3. Use Playwright's `storageState` to persist login sessions

### Test Data
The tests are designed to be flexible and use conditional checks to handle:
- Missing elements (test won't fail if element doesn't exist)
- Different page states
- Varying authentication setups

### Updating Tests
When the UI changes:
1. Update selectors in the test file
2. Adjust timeout values if needed
3. Update expected behaviors

### Best Practices
- Keep tests independent (each test should work on its own)
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Add `await page.waitForTimeout()` when needed for animations
- Use conditional checks for optional elements

## Troubleshooting

### Tests timing out
- Increase timeouts in the test or config
- Check if the dev server is running
- Verify elements are actually visible on the page

### Elements not found
- Verify selectors match the actual HTML
- Check if elements are hidden or not rendered yet
- Add appropriate wait conditions

### Authentication issues
- Set up test authentication flow
- Use `storageState` to reuse login sessions
- Consider mocking authentication for tests

## CI/CD Integration

To run tests in CI:
```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: npm ci
  
- name: Install Playwright browsers
  run: npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
  
- name: Run E2E tests
  run: npm run test:e2e
  
- name: Upload test results
  if: always()
  uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
  with:
    name: playwright-report
    path: playwright-report/
```

## Viewing Test Reports

After running tests, view the HTML report:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```
